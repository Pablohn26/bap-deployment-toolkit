# BAP Deployment Toolkit

This repository provides a set of tools to deploy instances of the
[Bitergia Analytics Platform (BAP)](https://github.com/bitergia-analytics/)
on different cloud providers, using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
and [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) for provisioning and installing.

The latest version of the toolkit supports the next cloud providers:

- [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/gcp)

This toolkit is released under the terms of the [GPL3 or later license](LICENSE).

## Requirements

The current version of the toolkit requires:

- Debian 11 (bullseye) or Ubuntu 20.04 (or later).
- Python 3.8 (or later)
- Terraform 1.3 (or later)
- Ansible 6.4 (or later)

Take into account other Linux distributions might work but the ones listed
here are the ones used to test the toolkit. Additionally, this documentation
contains the steps necessary to install Terraform and Ansible.

## Structure of this repository

The `terraform` directory stores the modules needed to provision the platform
on the cloud providers supported by the toolkit. Inside, you can find an
`environments` directory where you can store the different configurations
for the environments you would like to provision.

The `ansible` directory contains all the Ansible roles and playbooks to install
and configure the platform. As the `terraform` dir, it has an `environments`
folder to store the Ansible configurations for all your environments.

The `keys` directory provides a central place to store all of your keys. It is
configured in `.gitignore` to never be included with any Git commit by default,
to avoid exposing credentials.

The `docs` directory provides the documentation files that will help you to
deploy and configure the platform.

## Acknowledgement

This toolkit was inspired by the roles and recipes that √Ångel Jara developed
as a member of Bitergia and by the amazing job the people of
GitLab are doing with their [GitLab Environment Toolkit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-environment-toolkit).
